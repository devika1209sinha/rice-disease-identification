Brown Spot,"Brown spot has been historically largely ignored as one of the most common and most damaging rice diseases. Brown spot is a fungal disease that infects the coleoptile, leaves, leaf sheath, panicle branches, glumes, and spikelets. Its most observable damage is the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf. When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or discolored seeds are formed.",brownSpot.png,brownSpot2.jpg,brownSpot3.jpg,brownSpot4.jpg,Cause and Effect,"Brown spot causes both quantity and quality losses. On average, the disease causes 5% yield loss across all lowland rice production in South and Southeast Asia. Severely infected field can have as high as 45% yield loss. Heavily infected seeds cause seedling blight and lead to 10-58% seedling mortality. It also affects the quality and the number of grains per panicle, and reduces the kernel weight. ",Solution,"Improving soil fertility is the first step in managing brown spot. To do this:

1. monitor soil nutrients regularly
2. apply required fertilizers
3. for soils that are low in silicon, apply calcium silicate slag before planting

Fertilizers, however, can be costly and may take many cropping seasons before becoming effective. More economical management options include:

1. Use resistant varieties.  Contact your local agriculture office for up-to-date lists of varieties available.
2. Use fungicides (e.g., iprodione, propiconazole, azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, and carbendazim) as seed treatments.
3. Treat seeds with hot water (53-54 degree celsius) for 10-12 minutes before planting, to control primary infection at the seedling stage. To increase effectiveness of treatment, pre-soak seeds in cold water for eight hours."
Bacterial Leaf Blight,"Bacterial blight is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves. Bacterial blight is one of the most serious diseases of rice. The earlier the disease occurs, the higher the yield loss. Yield loss due to bacterial blight can be as much as 70% when susceptible varieties are grown, in environments favorable to the disease. When plants are infected at boo ing stage, bacterial blight does not affect yield but results in poor quality grains and a high proportion of broken kernels.",leafBlight.png,leafBlight2.png,leafBlight3.jpg,leafBlight4.jpg,Cause and Effect,"The disease is most likely to develop in areas that have weeds and stubbles of infected plants. It can occur in both tropical and temperate environments, particularly in irrigated and rainfed lowland areas. In general, the disease favors temperatures at 25-34 degree celsius, with relative humidity above 70%.",Solution,"Planting resistant varieties has been proven to be the most efficient, most reliable, and cheapest way to control bacterial blight.

Other disease control options include:

1. Use balanced amounts of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen.
2. Ensure good drainage of fields (in conventionally flooded crops) and nurseries.
3. Keep fields clean. Remove weed hosts and plow under rice stubble, straw, rice ratoons and volunteer seedlings, which can serve as hosts of bacteria.
4. Allow fallow fields to dry in order to suppress disease agents in the soil and plant residues."
Leaf Blast,"Blast is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. It can affect all above ground parts of a rice plant: leaf, collar, node, neck, parts of panicle, and sometimes leaf sheath.",leafBlast.png,leafBlast2.jpg,leafBlast3.jpg,leafBlast4.jpg,Cause and Effect,"Blast can occur wherever blast spores are present. It occurs in areas with low soil moisture, frequent and prolonged periods of rain shower, and cool temperature in the daytime. In upland rice, large day-night temperature differences that cause dew formation on leaves and overall cooler temperatures favor the development of the disease.",Solution,"The primary control option for blast is to plant resistant varieties. Contact your local agriculture office for up-to-date lists of varieties available.

Other crop management measures can also be done, such as:

1. Adjust planting time. Sow seeds early, when possible, after the onset of the rainy season.
2. Split nitrogen fertilizer application in two or more treatments. Excessive use of fertilizer can increase blast intensity.
3. Flood the field as often as possible.

Silicon fertilizers (e.g., calcium silicate) can be applied to soils that are silicon deficient to reduce blast. However, because of its high cost, silicon should be applied efficiently. Cheap sources of silicon, such as straws of rice genotypes with high silicon content, can be an alternative. Care should be taken to ensure that the straw is free from blast as the fungus can survive on rice straw and the use of infected straw as a silicon source can spread the disease further.

Systemic fungicides like triazoles and strobilurins can be used judiciously for control to control blast. A fungicide application at heading can be effective in controlling the disease."
